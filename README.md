#  AsynchronousInterprocessCommunication

NSItemProvider is still needed for some aspects of iOS and macOS development, even with SwiftUI and its more modern philosophy.

This package offers some async/await - conformant strategies for getting data from NSItemProvider and other simlar Foundation objects.

NOTE: this package is complied in Swift 5 explicitly. It will not compile using Swift 6
